A Non-Medical Expenses Cover is a valuable addition to your health insurance policy, designed to provide financial support beyond the usual medical expenses. This optional rider, available as a separate add-on, offers a specific sum insured for covering non-medical costs associated with illness or injury. For example, this could include expenses like travel costs to receive treatment, accommodation expenses during hospitalization, or the cost of hiring a caregiver while recovering.

The limit for Non-Medical Expenses typically varies depending on the insurance provider and the chosen health insurance plan. However, you can often find policies offering up to Rs. 5,00,000 in coverage for non-medical expenses, providing significant financial assistance during challenging times. By opting for this rider, you can ensure that you are adequately protected against the unexpected financial burden of non-medical costs associated with health issues, allowing you to focus on your recovery without worrying about the associated expenses.
