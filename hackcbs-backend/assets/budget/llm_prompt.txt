This year's budget focuses on building a developed India ("Viksit Bharat") by boosting four key engines: agriculture, MSMEs, investment, and exports, fueled by crucial reforms.  We'll enhance agricultural productivity through the Prime Minister DhanDhaanya Krishi Yojana, focusing on 100 low-productivity districts.  Simultaneously, we're launching a rural prosperity program to create opportunities and reduce rural-urban migration.  To support MSMEs, we're increasing credit availability and introducing credit cards for micro-enterprises.  Investment will be driven by increased spending on education and healthcare, along with infrastructure projects and reforms in the power and mining sectors. Finally, export promotion will be enhanced through a new Export Promotion Mission and digital trade infrastructure.  These measures, coupled with tax reforms, aim to create a more inclusive and prosperous India.
