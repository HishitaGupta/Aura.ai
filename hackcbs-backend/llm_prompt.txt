Bajaj Allianz's Health Infinity Policy is a comprehensive health insurance plan designed to protect you and your family from the financial burden of medical expenses. It offers a range of features, making it a perfect choice for those seeking peace of mind.

One of the key highlights is the unlimited sum insured, meaning you can claim as much as you need, without any limits. It also introduces the flexibility of choosing your preferred daily room rent, allowing you to tailor the policy to your budget.

The policy provides coverage for a wide range of medical expenses, including inpatient hospitalization, pre-hospitalization, post-hospitalization, road ambulance, day-care procedures, and preventive health check-ups. You'll also receive income tax benefits on the premiums you pay.

Beyond these core benefits, the policy includes a valuable wellness discount, offering a 5% reduction in your premium at every renewal if you maintain a healthy lifestyle and provide specific medical test reports.

Additionally, there are various discounts available for families, long-term policies, and employees of Bajaj Allianz. If you purchase the policy online, you can avail of a special 5% discount.

For those looking to switch from another health insurance policy, Health Infinity offers a portability feature that allows you to bring your existing coverage with you.

Remember, it's crucial to understand the policy's exclusions and waiting periods. Certain medical conditions or procedures may have a waiting period before they're covered, so it's important to review the policy documents carefully.

Health Infinity offers two claim settlement options: cashless and reimbursement. Cashless treatment is available at network hospitals, while reimbursement claims require you to pay for the medical expenses upfront and then claim the amount back from Bajaj Allianz.

To buy this policy, contact your insurance advisor or visit Bajaj Allianz's website. Make sure to ask about the charges and exclusions before filling the proposal form. 

With its comprehensive coverage, attractive discounts, and convenient claim process, Bajaj Allianz's Health Infinity Policy provides a strong foundation for securing the well-being of your family.
