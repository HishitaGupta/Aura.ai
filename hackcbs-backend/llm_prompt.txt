Bajaj Allianz's Health Infinity policy is a comprehensive health insurance plan designed to protect you and your family from the financial burden of medical expenses. This policy comes with unlimited sum insured, meaning there's no limit on the amount you can claim, giving you peace of mind. 

One of the unique features of Health Infinity is the concept of choosing your preferred room rent. This lets you customize your coverage based on your needs and budget.  The policy also offers pre-hospitalization coverage for 60 days before hospitalization and post-hospitalization coverage for 90 days after discharge.  

Another important aspect of this policy is the coverage for day-care procedures. This means you're protected even for surgeries that don't require overnight hospital stays.  And to keep you healthy, Health Infinity provides a preventive health check-up every three years. 

With its comprehensive coverage, competitive premiums, and flexible features, Bajaj Allianz's Health Infinity policy offers a secure and affordable solution for your family's healthcare needs.
