Thinking about health insurance for your family?  Bajaj Allianz Health Infinity offers comprehensive coverage at competitive prices.  It's an individual plan, covering you, your spouse, children, and parents.  

One key feature is the unlimited sum insured.  You choose your daily room rent from a range of options, impacting your premium.  Pre- and post-hospitalization expenses are covered – 60 and 90 days respectively. Road ambulance coverage is included up to ₹5,000 per hospitalization.

The policy also includes day-care procedures and a free health checkup every three years.  There are no pre-policy medical tests required up to age 45, and pre-existing diseases are covered after 36 months.  Plus, you can get income tax benefits on your premiums.

While this policy offers extensive benefits, certain exclusions apply.  These include cosmetic surgery, pre-existing conditions (covered after 36 months), and specific procedures with waiting periods.  Details on these exclusions and waiting periods are available in the policy document.  It's a lifetime renewable policy, subject to annual renewal within a 30-day grace period.
