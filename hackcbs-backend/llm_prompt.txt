India's 2025-26 budget focuses on a "Viksit Bharat," or developed India.  Four key engines drive this vision: agriculture, MSMEs, investment, and exports, fueled by crucial reforms.  Agriculture's boost includes the Prime Minister DhanDhaanya Krishi Yojana, targeting 100 low-productivity districts.  Aatmanirbharta (self-reliance) in pulses is prioritized, alongside initiatives for edible oils and vegetables.  MSMEs get a classification revision, enhanced credit guarantees, and new credit cards.  Investment focuses on people (Anganwadi improvements, broadband for schools and health centers), the economy (infrastructure PPPs, asset monetization), and innovation (AI centers, a Deep Tech fund). Finally, export promotion will be strengthened through a dedicated mission and digital trade platforms.  These initiatives, along with tax reforms including substantial income tax relief for the middle class, aim to create a prosperous and inclusive India.
