India's 2025-26 budget focuses on inclusive growth, aiming for a "Viksit Bharat."  Four key engines drive this: agriculture, MSMEs, investment, and exports, fueled by reforms.  Agriculture gets a boost with the Prime Minister DhanDhaanya Krishi Yojana, focusing on productivity and credit. MSMEs see increased credit availability and revised classification criteria to encourage growth.  Investment is prioritized through enhanced healthcare, education, and skilling initiatives.  Finally, export promotion is key, with a new Export Promotion Mission and digital trade infrastructure.  The budget also includes significant tax reforms simplifying the process and benefiting the middle class with significant tax reductions. This multi-pronged approach aims to create jobs, improve livelihoods, and strengthen Indiaâ€™s global position.
