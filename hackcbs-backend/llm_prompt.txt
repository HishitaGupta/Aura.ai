Bajaj Allianz Health Infinity is a comprehensive health insurance policy designed to protect you and your family from the financial burden of unexpected medical expenses.  It offers a wide range of benefits, including unlimited sum insured, coverage for pre and post-hospitalization expenses, day-care procedures, and even preventive health checkups. 

The policy is available for individuals and families, and covers self, spouse, dependent children, and parents. It allows you to choose your room rent limit, offering flexibility to suit your budget.  You can also opt for different copayment options based on your preferred level of cost sharing.

One of the key features of this policy is the lifetime renewal benefit, ensuring you have continuous coverage as long as you renew annually within the 30-day grace period. Additionally, the policy provides coverage for preexisting diseases after a waiting period of 36 months, and includes a generous discount for wellness and family members covered under a single policy.

To make it easier for you, Bajaj Allianz provides both cashless and reimbursement claim options.  The cashless facility is available at their extensive network of hospitals across India, simplifying your medical expenses during hospitalization. For reimbursement claims, you can submit your medical bills and other necessary documents within 30 days of discharge. 

If you're looking for a comprehensive health insurance policy with a wide range of benefits and a user-friendly claim process, Bajaj Allianz Health Infinity is definitely worth considering.
