Bajaj Allianz's Health Infinity Policy offers comprehensive health insurance coverage at competitive premiums. This plan is designed to protect you and your family from the financial burden of medical expenses in case of hospitalization for illness or injury.

One of the key features of Health Infinity is its unlimited sum insured, meaning there is no limit on the amount of coverage you can receive. This provides peace of mind knowing you're financially protected regardless of the severity of your medical needs.

Another important aspect of this policy is the flexibility in choosing your daily room rent. You can select from various options ranging from ₹3,000 to ₹50,000 per day, allowing you to tailor your coverage to your specific needs and budget.

Health Infinity also covers a wide range of medical expenses, including pre-hospitalization costs for up to 60 days before hospitalization and post-hospitalization expenses for up to 90 days after discharge. It even covers road ambulance costs up to ₹5,000 per hospitalization, ensuring you have access to emergency transportation when needed.

In addition, the policy provides coverage for day care procedures, allowing you to receive treatment at a day care center instead of staying overnight in a hospital. And at the end of every three-year policy period, you're eligible for a free preventive health checkup, further promoting your well-being.

Health Infinity offers various discounts to make coverage even more affordable. You can get a wellness discount for maintaining good health, a family discount for covering multiple members, and a long-term policy discount for opting for a 2-year or 3-year plan.

For employees of Bajaj Allianz and its group companies, there's a special 20% discount, and for those who purchase the policy online, there's a 5% discount.

While Health Infinity offers comprehensive coverage, certain exclusions and waiting periods apply. Pre-existing diseases, for instance, have a waiting period of 36 months before they are fully covered, but the waiting period is reduced if you have continuous coverage under a previous policy. 

Specific diseases and procedures also have a waiting period of 24 months, after which the maximum limit for each claim is restricted to 100 times your daily room rent limit. It's important to carefully review the policy wording for a full understanding of these exclusions and waiting periods.

Health Infinity is a valuable investment in your health and financial security. Its unlimited sum insured, flexible room rent options, comprehensive coverage, and various discounts make it a strong choice for protecting you and your loved ones from the unexpected costs associated with medical emergencies.
